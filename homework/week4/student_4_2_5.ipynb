    " - Visualise your data\n",
    " - Answer three of your own questions that could be interesting given your data\n",
    " - Provide a short discussion (Â±150 words) on:\n",
    "   - quality of the data\n",
    "   - quality of the insights\n",
    "   - business value of the questions answered\n",
    " - Provide links and names to data sources used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extra:\n",
    " - Use more exotic or unstructured data types (`.arff`, `.log`, `.docx`, raw text or images)\n",
    " - Use large datasets (i.e. >500MB or >10.000.000 records)\n",
